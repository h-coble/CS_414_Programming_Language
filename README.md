This repository stores my homework assignments for CS 414 - Programming Languages.
None of these assignments were large projects; most were very specific small requests for us to write in each language.
The objective of the course was to learn about the different types/uses of various programming languages and how to learn a new one by
reading documentation and understanding Backus Naur Form (BNF) and Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF) notations.
